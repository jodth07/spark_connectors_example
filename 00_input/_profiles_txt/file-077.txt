General Overview of Consultants Technical Ability – Ranking 

He is okay with the general big data technologies. However, he needs to improve some of skills. My personal opinion for him is “Spark Developer” 

He may not be able to handle a situation that requires him to use diverse technologies at the same time. I don’t want him to go to lead position.
