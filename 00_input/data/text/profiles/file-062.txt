General Overview of Consultants Technical Ability – Ranking 

Jermain is technically weak. He is not strong in coding. However, he understands the concepts of those tools. I want him to go to positions of ‘dashboard,’ ‘admin,’ ‘big data PM,’ which don’t require a lot of coding. No lead position– senior position is okay.

-Admin/PM/Engineer 

-Ability to speak to resume: Proficient

-Preferred job description titles to look for: Big Data Engineer / Hadoop Admin 

-Could this person be a lead? - No
