General Overview of Consultants Technical Ability – Ranking 

Josh is a fast learner. He doesn’t have a strong foundation in Big Data Engineering. But, he is improving a lot. If we can find him a position of ETL, RDBMS, OLAP and OLTP, he would perform better on that. He could work as a data engineer. Hadoop Admin is fine but not preferable. No lead position – senior position is okay.

-Admin/Engineer/Architect caliber: Developer/Engineer/

-Ability to speak to resume: proficient 

-Preferred job description titles to look for: Big Data Engineer / Data Engineer 

-Could this person be a lead? - No
